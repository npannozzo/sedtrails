I have now uploaded the three milestone benchmark runs based on the simple inlet model in D-Flow FM:
https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/XTybBx0YbcpueMW

Using ``\SedTRAILS_InputExamples\dfm\inlet_sedtrails.nc``, I created three runs using the following inputs:

1. ``SedTRAILS_input_inletFM_SinglePassiveParticleExample_v001.m``
2. ``SedTRAILS_input_inletFM_SingleSandParticleExample_v001.m``
3. ``SedTRAILS_input_inletFM_MultipleSandParticleExample_v001.m``

The above cases were run using the matlab code in this folder:
``\SedTRAILS_InputExamples\sedtrails\sedtrails_repo\trunk``
Each run took only a few seconds on my laptop:
1. Passive particle x1: 1.81 s
2. Sand particle x1: 1.79 s
3. Sand particles x242 (500m grid): 6.42 s

The output can be found here:
``\SedTRAILS_InputExamples\sedtrails\output``
